this app is good for beginners as the code is easy to understand ...basic statements and basic intent... but if you get stuck.. keep going :)


<h2>topics covered</h2>
<ul>
  <li>declaring variables</li>
  <li>strings and user input</li>
  <li>conditionals</li>
  <li>sorting & lists</li>
</ul>  


<h4>1. first things first</h4>
<p> The first thing we’re going to do is declare our variables. A variable is used to store a value, this is subject to change. In this case, each variable will store a number that corresponds to the number of times a user selected a statement that would put them in a specified house. For example, a user who picks mostly "a’s" will be sorted into Gryffindor, since the “a” answers correspond to Gryffindor traits. We'll calculate and sort at the end though. 
  
  each variable will start out at zero.</p>
  
  ```
gryffindor = 0
ravenclaw = 0
hufflepuff = 0
slytherin = 0
  ```
  

<h4>2. strings and things</h4>
<p>A string in Python is a sequence of characters. It is a derived data type. Strings are immutable. This means that once defined, they cannot be changed. Many Python methods, such as replace() , join() , or split() modify strings. Input() allow users to enter a value. In this case our input will contain a question that will allow our users to provide an answer.

use "q1_answer" to create a variable to store the 1st answer. </p>
```
q1_answer = input("""\nWhile walking down the street you see a wallet on the side of the road. It has a small amount of money in it,
but no identification of any kind. There is nobody in sight.
a) Leave it there. Someone is probably looking for it.
b) Pocket the money. You don't know who it belongs to, so finder's keepers
c) Take it to the police in case anyone ever reports it.
d) Take the wallet, and go around the area asking anyone if they have lost a wallet recently.\n""")
  ```
